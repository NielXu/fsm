# Intro
This repository contains tools for user to create finite state machines by defining their own states and transition functions. FSM is useful in some cases such as parsing command, implmeneting a tokenizer and so on. `simplefsm.py` can handle reading of sequences, such as reading a string or a list. However, if one wants to store variables and create more complex transition functions, `fsm.py` should be used.
